# Lift

This project is an Elevator Control System developed using Blazor, Fusion for real-time state updates, and Entity Framework Core for data access. It simulates the behavior of an elevator, including floor requests, direction changes, and elevator state updates. The system supports a real-time interface that reflects the current elevator state as well as handles multiple requests.

## Features

### Real-time State Updates
- Using the Fusion library, the elevator's current state (e.g., floor, direction, busy status) updates automatically in the UI.

### Elevator Request
- Users can request the elevator to a specified floor, and the system will handle the direction and floor change accordingly.

### Database Integration
- The elevator states and requests are stored in a database using Entity Framework Core.

### Dynamic Floor Management
- Users can select a floor (1 to 10), and the system will compute the elevator's movement in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Blazor Server**: For building the interactive web UI.
- **Fusion**: For real-time state management and automatic UI updates.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM and database management.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing elevator states and requests.

## Changes
- **docker-compose.yml**: Added a Docker Compose configuration to set up the C# application and PostgreSQL database in separate containers.
- **PostgreSQL Configuration**: The PostgreSQL container is configured with necessary environment variables for user, password, and database.
- **C# App Configuration**: The application is set to use the PostgreSQL database connection string from environment variables.

## How to Use Docker Compose

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running. For Windows, download it from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose comes bundled with Docker Desktop, so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.
